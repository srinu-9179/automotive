# Atomotive Helmet-Detection-using-yoloV8
This project aims to develop an automated helmet detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

 Week 1 â€“ Project Initialization & Planning
Objectives

Decide project title and theme.

On Monday	Title Finalization	Selected project title: Helmet Detection using Deep Learning (Automotive Theme)
On Tuesday	Literature Review	Studied about YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 architectures for object detection.
On Wednesday	Problem Definition	Defined scope: Detect riders and identify helmet usage for road safety.
On Thursday	Tool Selection	Finalized Python, YOLOv8, and OpenCV for implementation.
On Friday	GitHub Setup	Created and initialized GitHub repository.
On Saturday	Dataset Research	Explored open-source datasets for helmet/no-helmet images.
On Sunday	Documentation	Wrote README.md with objectives and week summary.
